# Machine Learning Project: _Child Mind Institute — Problematic Internet Use_

## Introduction:
We are participating in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/overview) to develop a predictive model that analyzes children's physical activity data to predict the level of problematic internet usage. The goal of our project is to use easily obtainable physical fitness indicators to identify early signs of excessive internet use, enabling timely interventions that promote healthier digital habits.
